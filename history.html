                On April 23, 1946 Piaggio applied for a patent with the Central Patents Office at the Ministry of
                Industry
                and Commerce in Florence, describing the Vespa as “a motorcycle with a rational complex of organs and
                elements with body combined with the mudguards and bonnet covering all the mechanical parts”.

                The first glimpse of the Vespa the public saw was on the cover of the popular Italian magazine La Moto
                on
                April 15, 1946 and, following this, it was launched at the 1946 Milan design fair, a year ahead of its
                competitors, Lambretta. The reaction to the machine led to many copy-cat designs coming from overseas;
                Japan
                produced the Fuji rabbit, Germany produced several rival scooters with even Great Britain producing what
                it
                saw as a competitor, however in truth no rival company managed to match the beauty and charm of the
                little
                Italian scooter.
              </p>

              <p class="p2"> Piaggio propelled by the positive reactions to the scooter went into production with the
                Vespa 98,
                which
                sold well with the first years’ output being 2,484. This led to the larger 125 cc model being launched
                in
                1947. In its second year, the production had gone up to 10,353 and further increasing by 9,500 by the
                end of
                1948. The sales of the Vespa have continued to grow and, in June 1956, the millionth scooter rolled off
                the
                production line; 1960, a mere four years later, the number would rise to two million, paving the way for
                the
                scooter to go down in history as a unique phenomenon in the worlds’ motorised travel history.</p>

              <p class="p3">With its popularity and innovative design, it didn’t take long before the sexy little
                scooter started
                to
                appear in stylish magazines being photographed alongside models wearing the couture of the day.

                Soon just the name, Vespa, was linked with high fashion and images of handsome men zipping along narrow
                Italian streets or beautiful girls with their hair billowing behind them as they rode along coastal
                roads,
                creating a link with style that remains today.

                Hollywood has always had a love affair with the Vespa: in the 1953 film Roman Holiday, it could be
                argued
                that the scooter should have also received star billing after Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn, as it’s
                the
                images of them riding it through Rome that have helped the film endure.
                1884
                Piaggio is founded in Genoa by 20 year old Rinaldo Piaggio as a luxury ship building company that
                expanded into producing rail carriages, automobiles, marine craft and later aeronautics.

                1938
                Enrico Piaggio and his brother Armando inherited the family engineering business on their father’s death
                in 1938. Enrico decided to move the business from aircraft to scooter production after the end of the
                war as there was a need for low cost transport.
